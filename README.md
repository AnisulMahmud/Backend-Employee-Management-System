# Backend-Employee-Management-System


## Objectives:
### Authentication & Authorization: 
A user authentication system with JWTs using Passport. Support secure password storage with bcrypt. Set up rolebased authorization with “Admin” and “Employee” roles.
### CRUD Operations: 
Build APIs to perform CRUD operations on the Employee resource. Ensure only Admins can add or delete employee data. Ensure Employees can view and edit only their own data.
###  Database Integration: 
MongoDB for storing user and employee data. Utilize Mongoose for data modeling.
### Security:
JWTs and Passport middleware for protecting routes. Enforce password policies and JWT expiration times.
